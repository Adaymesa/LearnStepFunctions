# LearnStepFunctions

This is a workshop to learn how to develop and deploy [AWS Step Functions] (https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/step-functions/). You can find some tutorials I've written [here](http://vgaltes.com/tags/#serverless).

## Pre-requisites

## Serverless framework

We're going to use the [serverless framework](http://serverless.com) to deploy and test the step functions. The serverless framework is a NodeJS library, so first we'll need to install NodeJs. Go to the [NodeJS] website and install it in your favourite OS.

Once we have NodeJS install, we can install the serverless framework. To do that, open a terminal window and type `npm install serverless -g`. That will install the framework. To check that the installation finished successfully, type `sls -v` to see the installed version of the framework. At the time of writting, you should see `1.16.1`

## .Net Core

You can download the last version of the SDK, but we'll need to target netcoreapp1.0. So, go to the [official website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) and follow the instructions for your favourite OS.

## Javascript

If you've followed the steps to install the serverless framework, you should be in a good position to develop using Javascript.

## Python

Download and install the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
